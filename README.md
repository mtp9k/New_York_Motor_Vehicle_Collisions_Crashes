# New_York_Motor_Vehicle_Collisions_Crashes

Information on this dataset is found thought the NYC open data project. This dataset contains information from police reports "where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage". In this project I will explore the relationships of month, year, and location with the number of persons killed. 

The data set including the data dictionary was pulled from the following resource.
